# Machine Learning Scripts and Mini-Projects

This repository contains scripts and mini-projects created to support my participation in a Machine Learning course. The projects demonstrate fundamental ML concepts, explore algorithms, and experiment with hyperparameters.

1. perceptron.py

This script implements a Perceptron, one of the earliest machine learning models, based on the original paper:

Rosenblatt, F. (1958).
The perceptron: A probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain.
Psychological Review, 65(6), 386–408.
DOI: 10.1037/h0042519

This code is adapted from a 2023 Medium article, which explains:  
	•	The perceptron as a simplified model of a biological neuron with inputs, weights, and a step activation function.  
	•	Its training algorithm, which adjusts weights based on errors, enabling learning over time.  
	•	Its historical role in introducing machine learning concepts, despite its inability to solve non-linear problems like XOR.  

The article highlights the perceptron’s legacy as a foundation for advanced neural network architectures. It’s fascinating to see a 60-year-old concept in action, demonstrating concepts like learning rates and epochs still relevant in modern AI.

Getting Started

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x

Running the Scripts

To execute the scripts, simply run:
